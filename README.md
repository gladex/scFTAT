# scFTAT
scFTAT: a Single-Cell Annotation Approach Integrating FFT and Improved Transformer

* ScFTAT is a cell type recognition approach based on FFT and improved Transformer.It aims to provide researchers with a deep learning tool for single-cell classifying tasks.
* Current version: 1.0

### Setting up ###

* Setting up scFTAT requires an environment with Python 3.7 or newer, along with Tensorflow and other necessary machine learning libraries.
* Install all dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* scFTAT does not require database configuration.
* After setting up the above files, execute the code in the `train-test.ipynb` file in order.Note that the pkl file needs to be converted to CSV format before running.
* Since scFTAT is primarily used for research and development, it does not have a specific deployment guide. Please integrate it into your project or workflow as needed.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Please write appropriate tests for your contributions and ensure all tests pass.
* Submit pull requests for any changes. Project maintainers will review according to the project's coding standards.
